###################

Beside Indonesia language which is learned by Indoneisan society, there is Javanesse language as a local languange that is used and have to preserved. The morfology of Javanesse language is different with Indonesia language which has uniqueness and difficulties itself on its stemming process. The Algoritma stemminf of Javanesse language is developed by adapt Algoritma Nazief & Adriani and it is made based on the rules of Javanesse language morfology. Algoritma will delete ater-ater (prefix), seselan (infix), penambang (suffix) and bebarengan (confixes) also tembung rangkep (repeat word) and for every result will be compared to the dictionary. In this research, has been prepared dictionary and test document as much ten Javanesse language documents. From the total result of stemming words (13011 words), the obtained word and suitable with the expected result are 12323 words and the rest of it (687) are the unsuitable words. It can be calculated that the expected accuration stemming words are (12323/13011) x 100 % = 94.72%. Most of the designed algoritma give a good result but the unexpected word still happen.
